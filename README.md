# Dynamic_Calc
I am building a dynamic Calc as we have in our smart phone just to enhance my coding skill.
I am trying to do basic calculations like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division like for example given below
  Ex  1+3+234-34*34/4  << This type of calculation we often do in our calc's. 

So've decided to build my own calc, but in doing so, I'm encountering several issues like some operations are not executing.
Sometimes the result doesn't match to the expected result.

If anyone who is interested to help me solve this problem can reach me.
